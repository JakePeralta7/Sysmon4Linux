# Sysmon4Linux

## Overview
Just like sysmon (for Windows), this tool gives us visibility to what happens in our host.

The advantages for using Sysmon4Linux are:
- gives us rich events in the same structure as Sysmon4Windows
- unlike auditd, can actually tell us the username
- event filtering is highly customizable
